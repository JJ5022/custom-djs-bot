# Custom Discord Bot
This is my first discord bot that I will be making using discord.js. I intend to use this project as a way to learn the fundementals of discord.js and to learn how to make a bot that can be used in discord. This code will contain **a lot** of beginners mistakes.

This project uses TypeScript, Jest, and Node.js
## Usage

### Enviroment Variable
DISCORD_TOKEN: Your discord token, from [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

### Command Line
``` shell
$ npm install
$ npm build
$ npm start
```
